# motive-finding-problem
A class project in Bioinformatics algorithms. This program Decide whether or not the sub-string S is in the string L, and return the starting position of S in L if S is in L. this problem in the DNA computer called the motive finding problem,  Given a set of DNA sequences, find a set of l-mers, one from each sequence, that maximizes the consensus score. Where motive is a sequence pattern of nucleotides in a DNA sequence or amino acids in a protein. This assignment is just small scale of the motive finding problem which has a lot of constraints.
